HVM does not support currying of Rules
(Matteo a b) = 42

(Main) = ((Matteo 1) 2)
->
((Matteo 1) 2)

a possible solution is creating a number of rules equal to to number of arguments each with different number of arguments
(Matteo2 a b) = 42
(Matteo1 a) = @b (42)
(Matteo0) = @a @b (42)

(Main) = ((Matteo1 1) 2)
->
42
