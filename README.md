# agda2HVM compiler

Dependently typed languages such as Agda have the potential to revolutionize the way we write software because they allow the programmer to catch more bugs at compile time than classical languages. Nonetheless, dependently typed languages are hardly used in practice. One of the reasons is the lack of mature compilers for them.
This is the implementation of a new Agda compiler that targets the Higher-Order Virtual Machine (HVM).
